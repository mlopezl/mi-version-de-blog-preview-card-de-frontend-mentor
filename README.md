## Overview
This project is a **responsive blog preview card** that adapts to different screen sizes.  
It features a blog image, a “Learning” category tag, a title, a short description, and a footer with the author’s avatar, name, and the publish date.

## The Challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the card layout depending on their device’s screen size.  
- See hover state for interactive element title.  
- Read the blog info clearly thanks to a well-structured and semantic markup.

## My Process
1. Structured the HTML using semantic elements (like `<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`).  
2. Styled the layout with CSS and used **Flexbox** for alignment.  
3. Implemented hover effect on the title to make it interactive.  
4. Ensured the component is fully responsive by adjusting sizes, margins, and typographic scale.

## Built With
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Flexbox  

## What I Learned
- How to convert a design into real HTML + CSS.  
- How to apply hover state for better user experience.  
- How to manage typography, spacing, and alignment in a compact UI component.  
- The importance of semantic HTML for structure and accessibility.
